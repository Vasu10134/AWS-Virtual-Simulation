# AWS Virtual Job Simulation  

This repository contains the work I completed during my AWS virtual internship. It showcases my journey in designing and implementing scalable, reliable, and cost-effective cloud architecture using AWS services.  

## üåü What I Worked On  
- Designed a scalable hosting architecture for a startup using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.  
- Integrated multiple AWS services to enhance application performance, scalability, and redundancy.  
- Addressed real-world challenges like load balancing, database backups, and application scaling.  

## üìö What I Learned  
- **AWS Basics**:  
  - Learned about AWS, its types, services it provides, its architectural diagram, and its model.  

- **Technologies Learned**:  
  - **CodePipeline**: For setting up CI/CD pipelines.  
  - **Elastic Load Balancing**: To distribute traffic across multiple instances.  
  - **RDS**: For managing relational databases.  
  - **EC2**: To provide scalable computing power.  
  - **S3**: For secure and scalable storage solutions.  

- **Application Executors and Provisioning**:  
  - **EC2**: Virtual servers in the cloud for scalable computing.  
  - **Fargate**: Serverless compute engine for containers.  
  - **Lambda**: For running code without provisioning or managing servers.  
  - **Lightsail**: Easy-to-use cloud platform for web applications.  
  - **Elastic Beanstalk**: For deploying and scaling web applications easily.  

## üåç Practical Scenarios  
- **Scalable API and Web Hosting**: Designed an architecture to handle traffic spikes using auto-scaling EC2 instances and load balancing.  
- **Database Redundancy**: Configured RDS with a failover setup across multiple availability zones for high availability.  
- **Cloud Backup**: Leveraged S3 for storing database snapshots and application backups.  
- **DNS Management**: Used Route 53 for dynamic traffic routing and improved application reliability.  

## üöÄ Key Takeaways  
- Gained real-world exposure to AWS services and best practices in cloud architecture.  
- Enhanced skills in designing scalable and redundant cloud solutions.  
- Implemented automation for deployment and backups.  
- Collaborated on cloud-based projects effectively.
