# AWS Internship Repository

This repository contains the work I completed during my AWS virtual internship. It showcases my journey in designing and implementing scalable, reliable, and cost-effective cloud architecture using AWS services.

## üåü What I Worked On
- Designed a scalable hosting architecture for a startup using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
- Built a robust CI/CD pipeline using CodePipeline to enable zero-downtime deployments.
- Integrated multiple AWS services to enhance application performance, scalability, and redundancy.
- Addressed real-world challenges like load balancing, database backups, and application scaling.

## üìö What I Learned
- **AWS Fundamentals**: Gained hands-on experience with services like Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, RDS, S3, Route 53, and Elastic Load Balancer.
- **Cloud Architecture Design**: Developed a strong understanding of designing fault-tolerant and scalable cloud solutions.
- **CI/CD Best Practices**: Learned to implement blue-green deployment strategies for seamless application updates.
- **Cost Optimization**: Explored techniques to optimize cloud resource usage and manage costs effectively.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **AWS Services**: Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, RDS (PostgreSQL), S3, Route 53, Elastic Load Balancer, CodePipeline.
- **Programming and Scripting**: Python for application integration, Bash for automating tasks.
- **Version Control**: GitHub for managing and showcasing project work.

## üåç Practical Scenarios
- **Scalable API and Web Hosting**: Designed an architecture that can handle traffic spikes using auto-scaling EC2 instances and load balancing.
- **Database Redundancy**: Configured RDS with a failover setup across multiple availability zones for high availability.
- **Cloud Backup**: Leveraged S3 for storing database snapshots and application backups.
- **DNS Management**: Used Route 53 to route traffic dynamically and improve application reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Built
- **Hosting Architecture**: Designed a solution to host APIs and web applications using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up an automated deployment pipeline using CodePipeline integrated with Elastic Beanstalk.
- **Redundant Systems**: Implemented multi-availability zone setups for increased application availability.
- **Backup Strategy**: Configured a backup system for databases and static assets using S3.

## üöÄ Key Takeaways
This internship gave me real-world exposure to AWS services and best practices in cloud architecture. It enhanced my skills in:
- Designing for scalability and redundancy.
- Implementing automation for deployment and backups.
- Collaborating on cloud-based projects.
